Forked from [mackstann][] which did not have any activy for a year (when writing
this, end of August 2014).

There are other messy forks out there..., just check out for yourself, with
hundreds of lines for... what.

I've just started to lurn python with this. Be it. To get things done, you have
to do them, right?

Anyway, you need python-2[.7], older 2.6 version may work.

One do need MPRIS-2 compliant player for this fork. I don't wanna waste too much
time on too old sofware, so go see other forks, or the original fork to get MPRIS-1
support. FreeDesktop folks are saying to not use the older API security reasons.
I don't have the time to go dig up the whys. And anyway, nobody trust them.

Just put the script in your PATH to get going.
